# Testmail-Server support

Currently this is just a plain Dockerfile, where the image is build around python module DebuggingServer. It will be run on port 25 which can then be mapped to any other port when the container is started. 

## Todos

This is a basis for further implementation of a more versatile testmailserver feature for QA/Testing a.s.o.
